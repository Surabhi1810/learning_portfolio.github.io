            <h3>Course Overview</h3>  
            <p>This course dives deeply into the world of data structures and algorithms, emphasizing their creation, evaluation, and real-world applications in computational and engineering tasks. It integrates principles of mathematics, engineering, and advanced computer science techniques to equip students with the skills needed to analyze and solve a variety of computational problems.</p>  

            <h3>What is the Course About?</h3>  
            <p>The curriculum focuses on understanding the fundamental philosophies behind designing efficient algorithms and data structures. Topics include performance analysis methods, computational complexity, and strategies such as recursion, iteration, and backtracking. The course covers a wide array of data structures such as trees, graphs, heaps, and tries, as well as advanced algorithms for sorting, searching, shortest paths, and more.</p>

            <h3>Key Concepts / Things Learned in This Course</h3>  
            <h4>Time Complexity Analysis</h4>  
            <h5>Task 1</h5>  
            <p>In this lab, I learned the fundamentals of time complexity analysis. By analyzing various algorithms, I understood the significance of measuring efficiency and how it impacts the performance of applications. We explored big O notation and practiced calculating the time complexities of common algorithms such as sorting and searching.</p>  

            <h5>Task 2</h5>  
            <p>During this task, we implemented different data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and trees. By doing so, I gained hands-on experience with how these structures operate and where they are used in practical scenarios. This experience solidified my understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of data structures.</p>  

            <h4>Practical Implementation of Algorithms</h4>  
            <h5>Task 3</h5>  
            <p>This task involved implementing sorting algorithms, including quicksort and mergesort. I learned how different algorithms can significantly affect the performance of data processing tasks and how the choice of an algorithm depends on the dataset and required efficiency.</p>  

            <h5>Task 4</h5>  
            <p>We also worked on solving real-world problems using algorithms. Applying learned concepts, I developed solutions for graph traversal using depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). This practical application was critical in understanding how algorithms can be employed to solve complex problems effectively.</p>
